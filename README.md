## Workshop Information

**Workshop**: Getting Stated with R for Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis

**Date**: Wednesday June 5 2019, 5:45 -- 7:00 PM

**Location**: Georgia World Congress Center, A305

**Description**:

This workshop, targeted at beginner and aspiring R users, will introduce the R programming language and the ways it can be used for mass spectrometry data analysis (and data analysis in general). The workshop will start with a gentle introduction to R and the basics of using RStudio, followed by essential data manipulation and analysis strategies using base R and tidyverse packages. Finally, analysis examples utilizing various mass spectrometry specific R packages will be presented. The goal of this workshop is to help new R users get over some of the initial roadblocks beginners often face and to kickstart their efforts toward learning how to use R effectively for data analysis tasks. Bring your laptop to follow along with the examples. Preparatory material for the workshop will be provided at: https://github.com/ZenBrayn/asms-2019-r-workshop
