# ASMS 2019 R Workshop Information and Materials

**Getting Started with R for Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis**

*ASMS 2019 Annual Meeting*


## Workshop Information

**Workshop**: Getting Stated with R for Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis

**Date**: Wednesday June 5 2019, 5:45 -- 7:00 PM

**Location**: Georgia World Congress Center, A305

**Description**:

This workshop, targeted at beginner and aspiring R users, will introduce the R programming language and the ways it can be used for mass spectrometry data analysis (and data analysis in general). The workshop will start with a gentle introduction to R and the basics of using RStudio, followed by essential data manipulation and analysis strategies using base R and tidyverse packages. Finally, analysis examples utilizing various mass spectrometry specific R packages will be presented. The goal of this workshop is to help new R users get over some of the initial roadblocks beginners often face and to kickstart their efforts toward learning how to use R effectively for data analysis tasks. Bring your laptop to follow along with the examples. Preparatory material for the workshop will be provided at: https://github.com/ZenBrayn/asms-2019-r-workshop

## Pre-workshop Preparation

1. Install R and RStudio -- see the [Installing R & RStudio presentation](https://github.com/ZenBrayn/asms-2019-r-workshop/blob/master/installing_r.pdf) for detailed instructions.
2. Test your environment in RStudio
    - Launch the RStudio application
    - You should see a *Console* window on the left side, with information about the R version you're currently running.
    - Try entering a simple R command, e.g. `2 + 2`, to make sure R is working.
    - If there is a problem with your R installation, RStudio should display a warning dialog when you launch the application.  If this happens, re-check your steps in the above presentation and/or Google any error messages you get.
3. Install the `tidyverse` packages within RStudio using `Tools → Install Packages...`, then enter `tidyverse` in the `Packages` field of the dialog.  This will install multiple packages from the core `tidyverse` set that we'll used for the *Data Manipulation and Analysis* section. See the [tidyverse site](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org) for more information.
4. If you'd like to dig in more, check out the (free online) book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).  While not specifically targeted at beginner R users, it does give a friendly walkthrough of the entire data analysis cycle using R and the `tidyverse`.  This is a great resource for all R users of all levels.
